SOP: The Triad Collaboration Protocol
Objective: To ensure all application components are architected for maximum efficiency, self-healing capability, and commercial-grade stability.

The Mandatory Consultation Loop:
Before any file is created or modified in the Meta_App_Factory, the following Triad Review must occur:

Strategic Blueprint (Gemini - The Brain):

Analyze the user's high-level intent.

Break the request into logical modules.

Action: Generate the "Master Plan" JSON and pass it to Antigravity.

Implementation Architecture (Antigravity - The Architect):

Review the local environment (Docker, folder paths, existing scripts).

Identify potential "breaking points" or dependency conflicts.

Action: If complex logic or new code is required, Antigravity must trigger the Claude Code Executor.

Code Optimization (Claude - The Specialist):

Write the raw Python/HTML/JS code based on the Architect's requirements.

Implement Self-Healing Blocks (Try/Except logs that report back to the API).

Action: Return the optimized code to Antigravity for physical deployment.

Final Approval Rule:

"No agent shall finalize a file without an explicit 'Review Passed' metadata tag from at least one other member of the Triad. If an error occurs during execution, the Specialist - Critic must be summoned to analyze the logs before a second attempt is made."
