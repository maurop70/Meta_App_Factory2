# Alpha V2 Genesis — User Manual

## Version 3.0 | Lead Quant Architect System + V3 Streaming Engine

---

## 1. What Is Alpha V2 Genesis?

Alpha V2 Genesis is an **agentic trading intelligence system** designed to help you trade SPX Iron Condors systematically and with discipline. It combines:

- **Live market data** (SPX, VIX, IV Rank, HV, options chains via yfinance)
- **Cloud AI research** (N8N Genesis v3 workflows powered by Gemini)
- **V3 Streaming Chat** (SSE-powered conversational AI with context injection)
- **Local risk logic** (Loki Engine — the "Lead Quant Architect")
- **Daily thesis auditing** (Strategy Ledger — tracks whether your trade rationale still holds)
- **Multi-channel alerts** (Windows toast + mobile push via ntfy.sh)
- **Supabase Memory Engine** (persistent conversation history across sessions)
- **LangSmith Telemetry** (full trace observability for every LLM call)
- **Stability Suite** (7 built-in modules for resilience, monitoring, and auto-recovery)

The system does not place trades automatically. It **evaluates, recommends, and monitors** — you make the final decision.

---

## 2. How to Launch

Double-click **Alpha V2 Genesis.lnk** on your desktop, or run:

```bat
launch.bat
```

This will:

1. **Preflight Check** — validates .env keys, Python deps, N8N connectivity, and port availability. If any critical check fails, launch is aborted with clear error messages.
2. Kill any stale Python/Node processes
3. Start `server.py` (Flask + ngrok tunnel + V3 SSE streaming + graceful shutdown hook)
4. Initialize V3 Streaming Engine (`stream_bridge.py` — Vault, LangSmith, Memory)
5. Activate N8N Alpha workflows (6 workflows)
6. Serve the React UI at `http://localhost:5173`
7. Open your browser automatically

**On shutdown** (closing the Vite window or pressing Ctrl+C):

- N8N workflows are automatically **deactivated** to prevent execution burn
- Even closing the terminal window (X button) triggers graceful deactivation

The **N8N Ledger Cron** fires automatically at **09:15 EST on weekdays** to refresh all data.

---

## 3. Dashboard — Section by Section

### 3.1 ALPHA ARCHITECT Header

The top banner shows:

- **Last Updated** timestamp — when data was last fetched from the server
- **"⏳ Syncing System Intelligence..."** banner — appears when N8N Cloud research is unavailable and the system is using cached/local data

---

### 3.2 Genesis Hot Updates

Thin banner cards that appear **only when N8N pushes real-time intelligence**. They contain macro event alerts (e.g., "CPI release tomorrow: HIGH IMPACT"), position fixes, or urgent risk flags. These are pushed by the N8N Cloud workflow directly into the UI without requiring a page refresh.

---

### 3.3 Strategic Regime (inside Loki Proposal)

**What it is:** The current market classification that determines *which Iron Condor strategy to deploy*.

| Regime | Meaning | Strategy Used |
|---|---|---|
| `STABLE` | IV Rank < 30, VIX moderate, SPX in tight range | **7 DTE Tactical** — quick weekly premium, fast theta decay |
| `VOLATILE` | IV Rank ≥ 30 or VIX elevated | **45 DTE Core Income** — higher credit, wider buffers |

The regime is computed by Loki from live VIX, IV Rank (30d), and the spread between implied and historical volatility (IV-HV spread). A wide IV-HV spread means options are "expensive" relative to how much the market is actually moving — the ideal condition for selling premium.

**How to use it:** Follow the recommended strategy. Don't override it unless you have a specific view. If VOLATILE, expect wider suggested strikes and lower probability of profit targets.

---

### 3.4 Loki's Proposal

The main recommendation panel. Contains:

- **Recommended Strategy** — IRON_CONDOR_45D or IRON_CONDOR_7D
- **Suggested Strikes** — Short Put / Long Put / Short Call / Long Call
- **IV Window** — Put IV% and Call IV% on the suggested strikes
- **Entry Rating** — `STRONG ENTRY`, `GOOD ENTRY`, `MARGINAL`, or `POOR TIMING`

**Entry Score** is a composite of 5 factors:

1. VIX in optimal range (15–25)?
2. IV Rank above 30%?
3. IV-HV spread positive?
4. No imminent HIGH-impact events in the next 3 days?
5. Strike distance adequate given current expected move?

A score of 4–5 = STRONG ENTRY. 2–3 = MARGINAL. ≤1 = POOR TIMING.

**Trade Rationale** — the paragraph below the score is generated by the Strategy Ledger engine and explains *why* this specific trade makes sense given today's conditions. Save this for reference — it becomes the baseline against which daily drift is measured.

---

### 3.5 Active Trade Watchdog

**What it is:** Live monitoring of your currently open Iron Condor.

Shows all 4 strikes:

- 🔴 **Short Put / Short Call** — the legs that lose money if breached
- 🟢 **Long Put / Long Call** — the hedge legs that limit maximum loss

**Distance** is shown in dollar terms and % from current SPX. This tells you how far the market needs to move before your short strike is tested.

**Status badges:**

- `SAFE` (green) — all short strikes have adequate buffer
- `WATCH` (yellow) — one short strike within 1 expected move
- `DANGER` (red) — a short strike is being tested or breached

**Credit** and **Mark** show your original premium received vs current premium to close. P&L = Credit − Mark.

---

### 3.6 Challenger Trade Scan

**What it is:** Every day, the system asks: *"If I were entering this trade TODAY from scratch, what would the optimal Iron Condor look like?"* It then compares that to your current position.

**Why it matters:** Markets shift. The "perfect" condor from 3 weeks ago may not be the perfect condor today. The challenger scan surfaces whether a better risk-adjusted alternative exists RIGHT NOW.

**Key fields:**

- **Challenger Strikes** — the optimal strikes if entering today
- **Challenger Credit** — what you'd receive for the new position
- **Cost to Roll** — what it would cost to close your current position and open the challenger
- **Expected Move Match** — how well the challenger covers the current MMM (market-maker move)
- **Pivot Warranted** — YES or HOLD

**When to pivot:**
The system recommends pivoting only when the challenger's short strikes are materially wider AND the cost to roll is covered by the additional credit within 1 week. Otherwise, **HOLD** — your current position has already absorbed decay and pivoting resets the clock.

---

### 3.7 Macro Agent

**What it is:** A scan of upcoming economic events in the next 14 days that could spike volatility and directly impact your Iron Condor.

**Events tracked:** FOMC announcements, CPI, NFP (Non-Farm Payrolls), PPI, GDP, PCE, JOLTS, Retail Sales, Treasury auctions, Fed speeches.

**Impact levels:**

- 🔴 `HIGH` — can cause 1%+ SPX move intraday (FOMC, CPI, NFP). Consider widening strikes or waiting until after release to enter.
- 🟡 `MEDIUM` — can cause 0.3–0.8% move. Monitor, but not usually a blocker.
- ⚪ `LOW` — background noise, usually ignorable for SPX IC positioning.

**Sourced from:** N8N Calendar workflow which polls a financial calendar API. If N8N is offline, the system falls back to the locally cached `upcoming_events.json`.

---

### 3.8 Volatility Agent + N8N Forecast

**IV Rank (30d):** Measures how "expensive" options are right now relative to the past 30 days. Scale: 0–100%.

- `IVR > 50` → Options are elevated → More premium available → Favorable for selling
- `IVR < 20` → Options are cheap → Less premium, smaller buffers → Unfavorable

**HV (30d):** 30-day realized (historical) volatility of SPX. If IV Rank >> HV, the market is pricing in more fear than actually occurred — the "volatility premium" that Iron Condor sellers collect.

**Signal:** `SELL` = favorable conditions to enter. `WAIT` = IV is too low or conditions not ideal.

**N8N Forecast Badge:**
The colored badge (`BULLISH` / `BEARISH` / `NEUTRAL`) is the **Cloud Brain's 7-day directional bias**, generated by Gemini via N8N research workflows (Genesis v3).

| Forecast | What It Means | Adjustment |
|---|---|---|
| BULLISH | Cloud Brain expects upward pressure | Widen the call buffer slightly |
| BEARISH | Cloud Brain expects downward pressure | Widen the put buffer slightly |
| NEUTRAL | No directional edge detected | Symmetric IC, no adjustment needed |

🟢 = Live from N8N Genesis v3  
🔴 = Cached / Gemini local fallback (still valid, just not live N8N)

---

### 3.9 Sentiment Agent

**What it is:** News bias score derived from recent SPX-related headlines.

- **BULLISH** — Recent news skews positive (earnings beats, rate cut expectations, risk-on flow)
- **BEARISH** — Recent news skews negative (geopolitical risk, Fed hawkishness, recession signals)
- **NEUTRAL** — Mixed signals, no clear directional narrative

Used as a **tiebreaker** for strike selection: if sentiment is BEARISH with a NEUTRAL forecast, Loki may widen the put-side buffer slightly.

---

### 3.10 Risk Guardian

**What it is:** The final safety veto. A checklist gatekeeper that runs BEFORE any trade recommendation is finalized.

**APPROVED** (green) = All safety conditions pass. Safe to follow Loki's recommendation.
**VETOED** (red) = One or more safety conditions failed. Do NOT enter the trade.

**Safety conditions checked:**

1. IV Rank ≥ 20% (enough premium to justify the trade)
2. VIX < 40 (extreme volatility makes IC highly risky)
3. Sufficient capital available (based on your Availability $ setting)
4. No expiry in less than 3 days (gamma risk)
5. Strike distances within acceptable range

If vetoed, the reasons are displayed below the badge.

---

## 4. Strategy Ledger (Bottom of Dashboard)

The Strategy Ledger is the most sophisticated section of the system. It runs every morning at **09:15 EST** and performs a full audit of your open position against the conditions that justified opening it.

### 4.1 Thesis Status Badge

The single most important indicator in the ledger.

| Status | Drift Score | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 `THESIS INTACT` | +1 to +6 | Market conditions still validate the original trade rationale |
| ⚪ `THESIS NEUTRAL` | -1 to 0 | Minor drift — monitor but no action needed |
| 🟡 `THESIS DRIFTING` | -2 | Two or more entry conditions have deteriorated |
| 🔴 `THESIS BROKEN` | ≤-3 | Trade rationale has fundamentally changed — seriously consider closing or rolling |

**Drift Score** is computed from 6 daily factors:

1. VIX move since entry (+1 if stable, -1 if spiked >20%, -2 if spiked >40%)
2. SPX move since entry (+1 if within range, -1 if outside expected move)
3. IV-HV spread (+1 if maintained, -1 if collapsed)
4. Days to upcoming HIGH-impact event (-1 if event within 2 days)
5. P&L momentum (+1 if capturing theta, -1 if losing)
6. Time value remaining (+1 if >21 DTE, neutral if ≤21 DTE)

**When to act on THESIS BROKEN:**

- Close the position if you're at >30% maximum loss
- Roll to a better strike set (pivot) if the challenger scan shows a worthy alternative
- If P&L is still positive, consider closing early and waiting for a better entry

---

### 4.2 P&L Progress Bar

A visual representation of profit captured toward the **50% profit target**.

- The bar fills left-to-right as you capture more of the original credit
- The **yellow vertical marker at 50%** marks the standard profit-taking threshold
- **Standard protocol**: Close the position at 50% profit OR at 21 DTE, whichever comes first

**Why 50%?** Backtesting shows that the additional profit from holding past 50% (the remaining 50% of max profit) requires disproportionately long time exposure to gamma risk. Taking profit at 50% and re-entering a fresh position produces better risk-adjusted annual returns.

**Why 21 DTE?** Gamma risk increases sharply inside 21 days to expiration. The position requires more active management, slippage increases, and the edge from selling premium diminishes.

---

### 4.3 Greeks (θ, ν, δ)

Real Black-Scholes analytical Greeks computed from live bid/ask quotes and implied volatility.

| Greek | Symbol | What It Measures | Healthy Range for IC |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Theta** | θ | Daily time-decay income collected per contract | +$5 to +$30/day |
| **Vega** | ν | P&L change per 1 percentage point VIX move | Negative (short vega is expected for IC) |
| **Delta** | δ | Directional exposure per $1 SPX move | -$5 to +$5/pt (near neutral) |

**Theta** should be positive (working in your favor) — your position decays toward profit each day.

**Vega** will be negative for a standard Iron Condor — you lose money when VIX rises. This is the primary risk of the strategy. Vega exposure tells you exactly how much you'd lose in a volatility spike.

**Delta** near zero means the position is balanced. Large positive delta means you're implicitly betting on upside; large negative delta means you're bearish. The Challenger Scan will flag if your delta is significantly off-center and there's a more neutral alternative.

---

### 4.4 Theta Decay Curve

A mini SVG chart showing your **projected position value from today to expiry**.

- **Blue curved line** — theoretical premium decay path (non-linear, accelerates near expiry)
- **Blue dot** — current mark (your position's current value)
- **Yellow dashed horizontal line** — 50% profit target
- **Grey dashed vertical line** — 21 DTE exit window
- **Colored vertical lines** — upcoming catalyst events (🔴 = HIGH impact, 🟡 = MEDIUM)

The curve uses a power model (exponent 0.65) to capture the reality that theta accelerates in the final 3–4 weeks — the gamma risk zone where positions need active management.

**How to read it:** If the blue dot is above the yellow dashed line (mark > 50% of credit), you haven't yet hit your profit target. As time passes and the dot moves right along the curve, your position converges toward zero premium = maximum profit capture.

---

### 4.5 Entry Rating, Challenger Scan, Next Catalyst

Three quick-reference indicators at the bottom of each position card:

**Entry Rating:** How good were the conditions when you originally entered?

- 🟢 STRONG ENTRY (score 4–5): Near-ideal conditions. High confidence the trade was well-timed.
- 🟡 GOOD ENTRY (score 3): Solid conditions with minor caveats.
- 🟠 MARGINAL (score 2): Acceptable but not ideal. Extra vigilance warranted.
- 🔴 POOR TIMING (score 0–1): Entry was premature. Learn from this for next time.

**Challenger Scan:**

- ✔ HOLD — Your current position is still the best or comparable to any alternative. No action needed.
- ⚠️ PIVOT — A demonstrably better IC exists today. The pivot rationale detail shows cost to roll and net credit improvement.

**Next Catalyst:** The nearest upcoming HIGH or MEDIUM impact event. Format: `Event Name (T-Xd)` where X is days until the event. If a catalyst is within 2 days, the system applies a drift penalty and increases scrutiny.

---

### 4.6 Drift Flags

Text flags at the bottom of the position card explain what's driving the drift score up or down.

**Positive flags (green):**

- `EDGE: IV-HV spread maintains seller advantage` — good
- `TAILWIND: Time decay working in your favor` — good
- `STABLE: SPX movement within expected range` — good

**Risk flags (red):**

- `DRIFT: VIX elevated vs entry level` — volatility expanding
- `WARNING: Short strike within 1 expected move` — position at risk
- `WARNING: HIGH-impact event in 2 days` — catalyst risk

---

## 5. Trade Journal Tab

Click **📘 Trade Journal** tab (next to 📊 Dashboard) to view your complete history of closed positions.

### Columns

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Trade ID | System-generated identifier (e.g., `spx_ic_20260223_01`) |
| Strategy | IRON_CONDOR_45D or IRON_CONDOR_7D |
| Opened | Date position was entered |
| Closed | Date position was archived (when removed from portfolio.json) |
| Days | How many calendar days the position was held |
| Credit | Premium received when opening |
| Close | Mark price when closed |
| P&L $ | Realized profit/loss in dollars |
| P&L % | P&L as a % of maximum possible profit (entry credit) |
| Drawdown | Maximum adverse move during the hold period (% above entry credit) |
| Rating | Entry rating at time of opening |

### How a trade gets journaled

1. You open a trade → Add entry to `portfolio.json` with `"status": "OPEN"`
2. You close the trade → Remove the entry OR change `"status": "CLOSED"`
3. Next ledger run (09:15 EST or server restart) → System detects closed position and archives it to `Alpha_Data/trade_journal.json`
4. Trade Journal tab populates automatically

---

## 6. Alert System

The system sends push alerts to three channels simultaneously when key events occur:

| Alert | Trigger | Channel |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 THESIS BROKEN | Drift score ≤ -3 | Windows toast + mobile + email |
| 🎯 PIVOT ALERT | Challenger is materially better | Windows toast + mobile + email |
| ⏰ 21-DTE EXIT WINDOW | Days to expiry ≤ 21 | Windows toast + mobile + email |
| ✅ 50% PROFIT TARGET | P&L ≥ 50% of entry credit | Windows toast + mobile + email |

**Mobile Setup (ntfy.sh):**

1. Download the **ntfy** app (iOS or Android)
2. Subscribe to topic: `alpha-v2-genesis-alerts`
3. Default server (ntfy.sh) — no account needed
4. Enable "Instant delivery in doze mode" for real-time alerts even when phone is sleeping

**Email Setup (optional):**
Add to `.env`:

```env
ALERT_EMAIL=your@email.com
SMTP_USER=your@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password   # Gmail App Password, not your login password
```

All alerts de-duplicate within each session — you won't receive the same alert type twice for the same position.

## 7. Intelligence Architecture (How the AI Chain Works)

```
Every 09:15 EST (N8N Cron) or on demand:

Step 1: Market Snapshot
   └─ SPX, VIX, IVR, HV30, skew, trend via yfinance

Step 2: N8N Genesis v3 (Primary)
   └─ Gemini via N8N Cloud → structured forecast JSON
   └─ FAIL → Step 2b

Step 2b: N8N Research v2 (Fallback)
   └─ Alternative N8N workflow
   └─ FAIL → Step 2c

Step 2c: Gemini Direct API (Priority 6 Fallback)
   └─ Calls Gemini 2.5 Flash directly (0 N8N executions)
   └─ FAIL → Offline stub (local sensors only)

Step 3: Loki Engine assembles all signals
   └─ Macro Agent + Volatility Agent + Sentiment Agent + Risk Agent
   └─ Determines Strategic Regime and recommends strikes

Step 4: Strategy Ledger (daily audit)
   └─ Detects thesis drift on all open positions
   └─ Fetches live marks and computes real Greeks (Black-Scholes)
   └─ Scans for Challenger trade alternatives
   └─ Fires alerts if thresholds crossed
   └─ Archives closed positions to trade journal

Step 5: UI Update
   └─ React dashboard polls /api/analyze + /api/ledger + /api/journal
```

## 10. V3 Streaming Chat Engine

The V3 engine adds a **real-time conversational AI** directly inside the dashboard. Instead of sending prompts through N8N webhooks and waiting for a response, the V3 chat streams Gemini responses **token-by-token** via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

### How It Works

1. **You type** a question or command in the chat bubble (bottom-right of the dashboard).
2. **Context injection** gathers your live dashboard state (SPX price, VIX, active trades, Greeks, P&L) and attaches it to the prompt.
3. **Local file ingestion** reads `strategy_ledger.py` and `market_memo.md` so the AI has full situational awareness.
4. **SSE streaming** sends the enriched prompt to Gemini 2.5 Flash and streams the response in real time.
5. **Supabase memory** persists the conversation so context carries across sessions.
6. **LangSmith** traces every call for debugging and performance monitoring.

### What You Can Ask

- "Should I roll my current Iron Condor?" (the AI sees your exact strikes, P&L, and Greeks)
- "What happens if VIX spikes to 30?" (the AI knows your current position)
- "Analyze today's macro calendar for my position" (reads upcoming events)
- Any freeform question — the AI has full context of your live dashboard

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `stream_bridge.py` | SSE bridge: Gemini streaming + context + history |
| `memory_engine.py` | Supabase conversation persistence |
| `vault_client.py` | Encrypted secrets (GEMINI_API_KEY, LANGCHAIN_API_KEY) |

---

## 11. Encrypted Vault

All API keys and secrets are stored in `vault.enc` (Fernet AES-128 encryption), never in plaintext `.env` files.

**Auto-unlock:** Place your vault password in `.vault_pw` (gitignored). The system reads it on boot.

**Current vault contents:** GEMINI_API_KEY, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, LANGCHAIN_API_KEY, N8N_API_KEY, NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN, N8N_WORKFLOW_ID, ALPHA_API_KEY.

---

## 12. LangSmith Telemetry

Every LLM call is traced to **LangSmith** under project `Alpha_V3_Streaming`. Visit [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com) to view:

- Token usage per call
- Latency and streaming performance
- Full prompt/response pairs for debugging
- Error rates and retry patterns

Tracing is enabled automatically on boot — no configuration needed.

---

## 13. Stability Suite (Operational Tools)

Seven built-in modules for system resilience and monitoring. All run from the command line.

| Tool | Command | What It Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Preflight** | `python preflight.py --app alpha` | Validates .env, deps, N8N, ports before launch |
| **Lifecycle** | `python n8n_lifecycle.py activate alpha` | Activate/deactivate N8N workflows |
| **Budget Guard** | `python n8n_budget_guard.py` | Check N8N execution usage vs monthly limit |
| **Error Log** | `python error_aggregator.py` | View recent errors across all apps |
| **Circuit Breaker** | `python circuit_breaker.py` | View webhook circuit breaker status |
| **Snapshots** | `python config_snapshot.py --list` | View config backup history |
| **Dashboard** | `python telemetry_dashboard.py` | Unified view of all subsystems |

**Telemetry Dashboard** is the single command to check everything:

```bat
python telemetry_dashboard.py
```

This shows N8N budget usage, circuit breaker states, recent errors, and config snapshot history in one view.

## 11. N8N Project Organization

As of v2.4, the n8n Cloud workspace has been reorganized from a flat list into **7 domain-grouped team projects**. This affects how you find and manage workflows in the n8n UI.

### Where to Find Alpha Workflows

All Alpha V2 Genesis workflows live inside the **Alpha Architect** project:

| Workflow | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Alpha Architect - Genesis (v3) | Primary AI research brain |
| Alpha Architect - Research (v2 Robust) | Fallback research workflow |
| Alpha_V2_Macro_Event_Tracker | Economic calendar polling |
| Alpha Ledger Daily Cron | Daily 09:15 EST ledger trigger |
| Alpha Phase 3 Logic (Push Mode) | Trade decision push |
| AI Agent workflow | Support workflow |

To access: Open [n8n Cloud](https://humanresource.app.n8n.cloud) → Click **Alpha Architect** in the Projects sidebar.

### Full Project Map

| Project | What's Inside |
| --- | --- |
| **Alpha Architect** | Alpha suite (8 workflows) |
| **HR Agents** | Resume parsing, email classifiers, policy chatbot (15) |
| **Specialist Agents** | CFO, CMO, Critic, Pitch Director, Elite Council (16) |
| **Loki — Master Formulator** | Formulation Engine, Ice Cream R&D (4) |
| **Meta App Factory** | Auto-generated app workflows (8) |
| **Alexa** | Alex Insight Engine (1) |
| **System & Infra** | Gemini Bridge, Claude Executor, Atomizer (8) |

> **Tip**: If you can't find a workflow, check that you're looking in the correct project. Workflows are no longer listed in a single flat view.

### GitHub Integration (Coming Soon)

A `git_deployer.py` module is planned to automatically push app code to GitHub after creation. This has been audited and planned but is not yet active — it requires a GitHub Personal Access Token to be configured. Once live, all apps created via the Meta App Factory will auto-deploy to a GitHub repository.
